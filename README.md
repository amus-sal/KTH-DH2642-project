# Getting Started with Bubo

Bubo is a web-based application designed to help users manage documents, communicate effectively, and track history within a streamlined interface. The platform allows users to create accounts, log in, and seamlessly navigate through key features such as uploading and organizing documents, integrating with an OpenAI-based chatbot, saving chat history, and viewing their activity. Built using React, MobX, and React Router, the application emphasizes clean state management and a user-friendly experience.
