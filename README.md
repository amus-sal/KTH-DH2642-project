# Getting Started with Bubo

Bubo is a web-based application designed to help users create  collective knowledge while using a chat to ask questions. The platform allows users to create accounts, log in, use a chat assistant to retrieve knowledge and verify the answer if they think that the answer is correct. The verified answer is then depicted at the history tab which is the same for all users. The app is built using React, MobX, and React Router, the application emphasizes clean state management and a user-friendly experience.

## What We Have Done

- Implemented a signup and login system using Firebase Authentication.
- Created a MobX-based model for state management, ensuring reactive data flow throughout the app.
- Developed a structured interface with a home page comprising the following tabs:
  - **Account Info**: Displays user details.
  - **Chat**: A chatbot interface powered by OpenAI, integrated to answer queries.
  - **History**: Displays the most recent verified answers and their related questions (planned functionality).
- Integrated OpenAI API for chatbot functionality.
- Used a lean react package to create the Chat called @chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react
- Created the functionality of verifying a response and storing the answer marked as verified along with the question it refered too
- Created the history tab where all verified questions and answers are shown to all the users

## Preparing Your Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application in your browser.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
